I am a junior undergraduate student at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT). My research interests include **AI for Science** and **Computer Vision**, and I am beginning to explore **large-scale foundation models**. I am advised by **Prof. Jianwei Zheng** (College of Computer Science and Technology, ZJUT). Feel free to reach out to me at [wenbin_lu@zjut.edu.cn](mailto:wenbin_lu@zjut.edu.cn).
